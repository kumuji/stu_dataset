## 💽 Data
- __STU__ dataset is available at [STU](https://omnomnom.vision.rwth-aachen.de/data/stu-dataset/).
- __PANOPTIC-CUDAL__ dataset is available at [Panoptic-CUDAL](https://github.com/DarrylTseng/PanopticCUDAL).

To verify that downloaded files are correct, you can verify the SHA256 hash of the files.
```bash
sha256sum -c file_sha256sum.chk
```

Overall the data follows the SemanticKITTI format.
```tree
|── 125/
|   ├── poses.txt
|   ├── calib.txt
|   ├── labels/
|   │     ├ 000000.label

```

Predictions are simple `.txt` files with confidence per point.

## 🏁 Evaluation
Simple evaluation for point-level anomaly segmentation:
```bash
python compute_point_level_ood.py --data-dir stu_dataset/val --pred-dir ./prediction
```

Simple evaluation for point-level anomaly segmentation:
```bash
python compute_object_level_ood.py --data-dir stu_dataset/val --instance-dir ./instance_prediction
```

## 🏎️ Training and Inference
Please check [Mask4Former3D folder in the repository](./Mask4Former3D/)

## 📒 TODO
- [ ] Open Public Test Submission
- [x] Release anonymized images
- [x] Release training code and checkpoints
- [x] Release code for points projection to images
- [x] Release the data
- [x] Release evaluation code

As of June 14, 2025, the public test submission is delayed due to the size of the test set and the computing requirements for evaluation.
I had initially planned to host the test set on Codalab/Codabench; however, a single submission for point-level evaluation would require a 3 GB upload, which is too large and takes too long to evaluate.
I will try to find a workaround for this limitation.
In the meantime, please feel free to evaluate on validation set, and if you have a method you would like to evaluate on test, email me and we can figure it out.

As of 12 November 2025, I have evaluated a few submissions to the test set.
If you would like to get the results for the test set, please send me a link to download your prediction files (Google Drive is fine, but something curl-able is better).
I will download the predictions and evaluate them using the following scripts:

1. [Compute Object-Level OOD](https://github.com/kumuji/stu_dataset/blob/main/compute_object_level_ood.py).
2. [Compute Point-Level OOD](https://github.com/kumuji/stu_dataset/blob/main/compute_point_level_ood.py).

Please ensure your files are in a compatible format.
